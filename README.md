DateApp
=======
 This is the Date application using jdbc.
 
 In java we cann't directly store string date into database date column.
 Because the the data types are different.
 
 Here in java we are parsing the date by using SimpleDateFormat class given in java.text package.
 
 I used Mysql Database software and mysql type4 driver. that is called mysql-connector jar file
